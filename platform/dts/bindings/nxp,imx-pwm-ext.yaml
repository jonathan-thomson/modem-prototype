      Select how to load the buffered-registers with new values:
      "immediate" - buffered-registers get loaded with new values as soon as LDOK bit is set;
      "half-cycle" - registers loaded on a PWM half cycle;
      "full-cycle" - registers loaded on a PWM full cycle;
      "half-and-full-cycle" - registers loaded on a PWM half & full cycle.
