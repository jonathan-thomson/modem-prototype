properties:
  use-internal-iref:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When external IREF is selected, the magnitude of IREF is controlled by
      the value of resistor, which is connected between IREF pin and VSS.
      When internal IREF is selected, the IREF pin should be kept NC.

  reset-period:
    type: int
    default: 4
    description: |
      Phase 1 period of driving an OLED pixel. Choose from 1-15 DCLK(s)

  precharge-period:
    type: int
    default: 7
    description: |
      Phase 2 period of driving an OLED pixel. Choose from 1-15 DCLK(s)

  front-clock-divider:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Front clock divider. Ratio is from 1 to 16 with default ratio = 1
      DCLK = Fosc / *D*

  oscillator-frequency:
    type: int
    default: 6
    description: |
      Oscillator frequency. Frequency increases as level increases.
      DCLK = *Fosc* / D

  second-precharge-period:
    type: int
    default: 8
    description: Phase 3 period of driving an OLED pixel. Choose from 1-15 DCLK(s)

  precharge-voltage-config-ext-cap:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      External capacitance mode is enabled when Vp pin 
      is connected to an external capacitor to GND in application.
      Default when Vp pin is float in application

  precharge-voltage:
    type: int
    default: 7
    description: |
      Precharge voltage level. Choose from 0-31
        0: 0.10 x Vcc
        7: 0.193 x Vcc
        31: 0.5133 x Vcc
      Value MUST be smaller than Vcomh voltage

  vcomh-voltage:
    type: int
    default: 4
    description: |
      Precharge voltage level. Choose from 0-7
        0: 0.72 x Vcc
        4: 0.80 x Vcc
        7: 0.86 x Vcc
      Value MUST be smaller than precharge voltage

  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: RESET pin.

      The RESET pin of SSD1363 is active low.
      If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
      as active low.

  ready-time-ms:
    type: int
    default: 100
    description: |
      Time it takes for the device from power up to become responsive and
      accepting commands. Defaults to 100ms if not provided.
